# gadmin_translation

Here you can download the translation files, so that way you can translate it to your main language.
It's pretty easy to do, just go to the languages folder, create a new text file, and name it yourlanguage.php, for example: deutsche.php (german).

These files use basic PHP Syntax, I explain a lot more about what to do in these files. Once you're done with a translation, you can hit me up by private message [here](https://www.gmodstore.com/users/view/76561198089591726) or [here](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fitz_Simmons/).
Thank you for supporting my script!
